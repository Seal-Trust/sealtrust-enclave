# Network access configuration for TruthMarket Nautilus Enclave
# Only these endpoints are allowed for HTTP/HTTPS requests from within the enclave
#
# IMPORTANT: The Nautilus enclave does NOT download datasets!
# It only receives metadata and signs it. No external HTTP requests needed.
#
# However, if you plan to extend functionality in the future, configure endpoints here.
